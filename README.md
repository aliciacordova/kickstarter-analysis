# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Our friend Louise's wants to analyze what is the relationship that could exist between the launch date and their funding goals in theater.  

### Purpose

Louse's will understand the most satisfactory period of months for theatrical release. And in addition to reviewing what is the established range for the goal of the successful projects of the "plays" subcategory.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

It can be observed in the analysis how the month of May represents the largest number of shows that are presented in theaters with a total of 166. Of which 111 (67%) of them have turned out to be successful and 52 (31%) of them a failure to meet the estimated goal for each one of them. Only 3 (2%) shows were canceled in May. 

In second position we could indicate that June would be the next month with the best outcome bases on launch date for theaters.

Additionally, it is observed that October is a month where theater shows are usually not canceled.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The analysis of results based on goals in theaters for the subcategory of "plays", showed that the highest number of projects are found in those that have a goal between the range of "1000 to 4999".

In the case of successful projects, despite the fact that the highest number of shows that successfully reached the goal were between the range of “1000 to 4999” (with a total of 388 plays), they did not represent the highest percentage of success (which was 73%) among the 694 successful plays that were made. Therefore, the range that targeted “Less than 1000” achieved a 76% success rate versus the other ranges.

For the projects that failed by not meeting the goal established between the range of "45000 to 49999", the graph shows us how the highest percentage of failure is raised by this range, since it represents 100%. In this case there was only one project for that category.

Additionally, it is observed that “Plays” in theater are not usually canceled.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

For the analysis base on launch date, the outcomes that are found "live" in theaters are not being taken into account, so the data we are analyzing is subjective.

For the outcome based on goal, the analysis is only being done for "plays", so the rest of the categories in theaters such as “musicals” and "spaces" are not being taken into account.

In addition, the data only shows a period of time, so the specific criteria used to collect the data must be evaluated.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    
    * Based on the launch date, we can say that May is the most successful month for the theater category.

    * October is a month where theater shows are usually not canceled.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    * Based on the goal, we can say that the lower the range established for the goal in the projects (less than 5000) the percentage of success will be much higher.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

    * In this way, it is important to highlight that in the results for these analysis we cannot generalize to complete category of “theaters” since there is data missing. Like others subcategories and outcomes.

    * We can have two points in the data that could be considered outliers. It is important to analyze them in detail to understand what could happen.

    * The season of the year in which the events take place must be taken into account since there may be a relationship between the weather and the date of launch. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  You can create many tables / graphs for example:
    - Based on year successful performance, by category and specific country.
    - Based on the average donation according to the subcategory.
    - How is the average donation performance by country?. 







# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns - MODULE EXERCISE

## Recomendations

   * Based on the launch date, we can say that May is the most successful month for the theater category.
   * October is a month where theater shows are usually not canceled.
   * Based on the outcome "Plays" is the most successful subcategory for theaters.
   * We can have two points in the data that could be considered outliers. It is important to analyze them in detail to understand what could happen.
